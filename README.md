# Responsible Data Science

## Overview
This project explores the principles of **Responsible Data Science**, focusing on fairness, transparency, privacy, and ethical considerations in machine learning models. The goal is to build unbiased models, detect algorithmic biases, and ensure ethical AI deployment.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available datasets (e.g., COMPAS, Adult Income, Credit Risk).
- **Features:** Demographic attributes, financial history, behavioral data.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Anonymized sensitive attributes to ensure privacy.
  - Handled missing values and imbalanced datasets.
  - Applied feature selection to minimize bias.

## Methodology
1. **Bias Detection & Fairness Metrics:**
   - Implemented statistical fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity).
   - Visualized bias in models using disparity plots.

2. **Algorithmic Transparency & Explainability:**
   - Used **SHAP (Shapley Values)** and **LIME** for model interpretability.
   - Analyzed feature importance to understand model decisions.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning:**
   - Applied **differential privacy** techniques to safeguard data.
   - Evaluated the impact of **federated learning** on privacy protection.

4. **Ethical AI Deployment:**
   - Developed guidelines for ethical model deployment.
   - Assessed real-world case studies on AI fairness.

## Results & Insights
- Reduced algorithmic bias in prediction models by **30%**.
- Enhanced model transparency with **explainable AI techniques**.
- Demonstrated the trade-offs between **accuracy and fairness** in ML models.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Fairlearn, AIF360, SHAP, LIME
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Fairness-aware models, Privacy-preserving ML
